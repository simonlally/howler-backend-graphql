# Howler

### About
Howler backend services were built with [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) and uses [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) as a NoSQL database.
